# Checkers
I'm building a checkers game as well as a checkers playing AI using the MiniMax algorithm.

# Information
I will assume that you already know how to play checkers.  If you don't Clyde woud go through a very very breif run of the rules.

I would want to warn you that you would be hit with a lot of dialogue boxes.  I would ask that you not just nonchalantly press "OK" because some of those dialogue boxes are going to be how you effect the setting of your game.  Like inputting how you would want to play, as well as your name and the name of your opponent.

# SOLID DISCLAIMER
I have to admit that this challeng was beyond challenging.  Like all the others, it showed me what I knew about programming wasn't enough, and they forced me to learn new ways of doing things and new aspects of programming that I didn't understand or know existed.  This project introduced me to the idea of the Minimax Algorithm.


I would like to state that 80 to 90% of the contents in this project do not belong to me... They belong to a YouTube Python Programmer who goes by the name "Tech with Tim".


### Explanation

So unfortunately, despite all the help I gained from multiple sources and all the retries I did, I was unable to create a working Checkers game that was capable of supplying all of the players possible jumps at any given time.

So a week before the due date, I took desperate action to atleast prevent from not supplying anything at all.

Tim has a 3 video playlist where he creates a working Checkers game using Pygame (Python).  Then he has a 2 video playlist where he impliments the Minimax algorithm into said Checkers game.  I followed those videos to make my project.

Now, I DID NOT just copy and paste his code into my project (that would be too low).  And as proof, I would have you look to the right where it states that my project is made primarily of JavaScript.  But Tim's project was made with Python.

What I did was, as he worked and explained the code, I did exactly what he did... But in JavaScript.  Think of it like tranlating Harry Potter to Italian.  The structure is the same, the plot and functionality is the same.  The way the computer shuffles data is the same.  The only difference being the language.

Because of that majority of the ideas behind my code comes from Tim.

To keep from becoming a code plagiarist, And to give Tim the credit he deserves, I will supply links to Tim's YouTube channel, the two playlists I spoke of, and his Github Reposotory below.

Now, all that's not to say I didn't write any original code.  There were still multiple things that Tim's code didn't have that I added.

__Stuff From Tim's Code__

+ General Game Functionality Including

+ Game Board Setup

+ Player Actions

+ Piece Movements

+ Minimax AI

<br>**Stuff I added**

+ Forced Jump

+ Option to switch between 2 players and AI

+ Winner's message and animation

+ Confetti (the code for that came from mathusummut, link below)

+ General HTML and Css Stuff
